Introduction 
In today's digital world, eCommerce websites have become essential for businesses to succeed and remain competitive. As online shopping continues to rise, having a reliable, user-friendly, and visually appealing website is crucial for attracting and retaining customers. This project focuses on creating an eCommerce website that provides a seamless shopping experience. 

Many businesses face significant challenges with their eCommerce websites. Some websites are outdated, difficult to navigate, or have poor usability, making it hard for customers to browse, compare products, and complete purchases. Furthermore, complicated content management systems often require specialized technical knowledge, which adds to the operational burden. In some cases, businesses may lack a proper website altogether, limiting their online presence and accessibility. These issues can result in poor customer satisfaction, increased bounce rates, and missed sales opportunities, ultimately hindering business growth (Nomensa, n.d.; SoftTeco, 2021).

The proposed eCommerce website aims to address these issues by creating a simple, clean, and easy-to-use platform that is compatible with various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops. By using HTML, and CSS. The website will provide a modern and responsive design that enhances the user experience. Customers will be able to easily navigate the site, view products, and read details. This will improve customer satisfaction, reduce bounce rates, and increase conversion rates, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of the business (BigCommerce, n.d.; Nielsen Norman Group, n.d.).

The primary objectives of this project are as follows: create a functional eCommerce website using HTML, and CSS that works seamlessly across multiple devices; design a modern, user-friendly interface with easy navigation, including pages such as a homepage with featured products, a product list page, a product detail page, and a cart page; ensure the website is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience; and implement simple and effective navigation features, such as intuitive buttons for adding products to the shopping cart and completing the purchase.

In conclusion, this project offers a practical solution to the common challenges faced by businesses with poorly designed eCommerce websites. By focusing on simplicity, responsiveness, and usability, the project aims to create an online shopping platform that enhances the customer experience and supports business growth. With its modern design and easy navigation, the website will attract more customers, increase sales, and help businesses thrive in the competitive online marketplace.
